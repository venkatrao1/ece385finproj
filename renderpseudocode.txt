when ready signal received:
grab current position from inputs
calculate directions of left and right rays

for each dist value:
	calculate left and right positions
	for each col:
		calculate slider position between left and right positions (either multiply or add iteratively?)
		look up map value (1 cycle here)
		perform height calculation based on dist and lookup table (1 more cycle)
		draw line if height on screen is positive

MAKE SURE WE SIGNAL IS SET PROPERLY
