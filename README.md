## Controls

 - Use the joystick to move forwards, backwards, and turn
 - Use the buttons on the right side of the DE10-Lite to look upwards and downwards
 - Rightmost switch is used to enable or disable flying mode
 - Second switch from the right enables a 'wireframe'/debug mode
 - Third switch from the right controls height while flying
 - Leftmost switch can be used to reset the circuit
